# 🛠 How Smart SDLC Works

Smart SDLC combines the traditional Software Development Life Cycle with AI automation. Each phase is handled by a dedicated AI agent that performs intelligent tasks to save time, reduce manual effort, and improve quality.

  
# 📌 1. Requirement Analysis

User Input: Business analyst or user uploads the requirement or user story.

AI Processing:NLP models classify and extract key features from the user story.AI maps the requirements to relevant SDLC modules (e.g., frontend, backend, database).

Outcome: Structured requirements stored in system tables for future steps.

# 📌 2. Planning

AI Assistance:Generates a task plan (timeline, milestones) based on requirements.Suggests technology stack and design architecture.

Outcome: Project plan with resource estimation and scheduling.

# 📌 3. Design

Generated Outputs:AI suggests system architecture (microservices, monolith, etc.).Auto-generates UI wireframes or layout templates.Produces ER diagrams and flowcharts based on inputs.

Outcome: Visual design blueprints and technical design documents.

# 📌 4. Development

Smart Code Generator:Converts structured requirements into working code snippets using AI models.Supports generation of frontend/backend logic and database schema.

Outcome: Auto-generated codebase ready for review and refinement.

#📌 5. Testing

AI Testing Engine:Auto-generates test cases and test data.Executes unit and integration tests with AI-analyzed reports.

Outcome: Bug reports, test results, and improved code quality.

# 📌 6. Deployment

DevOps Integration:Uses CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and deployments.AI monitors for deployment issues and rollback needs.

Outcome: Fast and reliable deployment to staging or production.

# 📌 7. Maintenance & Feedback

Smart Monitoring:Tracks performance and user feedback using AI-driven analytics.Suggests optimizations or bug fixes proactively.

Outcome: Continuous improvement cycle.
