# Smart SDLC – AI-Enhanced Software Development Life Cycle

Smart SDLC is an intelligent software development framework that enhances the traditional SDLC process using Artificial Intelligence. It helps in automating, optimizing, and managing each stage of the software life cycle—from requirement gathering to deployment and maintenance—using AI tools, models, and analytics.

Smart SDLC is a next-generation AI-powered software development framework that integrates artificial intelligence into every phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It automates and optimizes requirements gathering, code generation, testing, project planning, deployment, and maintenance, with intelligent agents and machine learning pipelines.

# 🧠 Backend Setup (FastAPI)

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-sdlc.git
cd smart-sdlc

2. Create a virtual environment & activate it:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set your environment variables:
Create a .env file in the app/ directory with the following:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
PINECONE_API_KEY=your-pinecone-key  # if using vector DB
DEBUG=True

5. Run the backend server:
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

> 🟢 API available at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs (FastAPI Swagger UI)

# 🌐 Frontend Setup (React Dashboard)

1. Navigate to the dashboard directory:
cd dashboard
